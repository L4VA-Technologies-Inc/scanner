3. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   node dist/db/migrate.js
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev    # Development mode with auto-reload
   # OR
   npm start      # Production mode
   ```

### Accessing the API
Once running, you can access:

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **Provider:** GitHub Actions
- **Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Triggers:** Push to `main` and `dev` branches.
- **Jobs:**
    - `build`: Checks out code, installs Node.js dependencies, builds TypeScript.
    - `push_to_registry`: Builds Docker image, tags it, pushes to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).
    - `deploy`: Connects to the Hetzner server via SSH, pulls the latest image, creates `.env` from GitHub Secrets, and restarts the application using `docker-compose`.
- **Secrets Management:** Sensitive values (Docker registry credentials, SSH keys, environment variables) are stored as GitHub Actions Secrets.

## Configuration

The service can be configured through environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| NODE_ENV | Environment (development, production) | development |
| PORT | HTTP server port | 3000 |
| DATABASE_URL | PostgreSQL connection string | postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cardano_scanner |
| JWT_SECRET | Secret for JWT token signing | default_jwt_secret_for_development_only |
| BLOCKFROST_API_KEY | API key for Blockfrost | - |
| BLOCKFROST_NETWORK | Cardano network (mainnet, preprod, preview, testnet) | mainnet |
| LOG_LEVEL | Logging level | info |
| WEBHOOK_MAX_RETRIES | Maximum webhook delivery attempts | 5 |
| WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY | Delay between webhook retries (ms) | 30000 |

## Security Considerations
- API keys should be stored securely (hashed, not plaintext)
- All API endpoints must enforce authentication
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database
- Implement proper input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Sign webhook payloads to ensure authenticity
- Implement secure key rotation mechanisms
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning

## Data Storage
- Store monitoring configurations in the database
- Maintain webhook registration and delivery history
- Cache relevant blockchain data for performance
- Implement database migration system for schema updates

## Deployment and Scaling
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Database replication for high availability
- Load balancing for API endpoints

## Monitoring and Alerting
- System health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Alert on service disruptions or blockchain anomalies
- Regular backup of critical data

## Future Enhancements
- GraphQL API support
- WebSocket notifications for real-time updates
- Machine learning for transaction anomaly detection
- Support for additional Cardano features as they are released
- Integration with other blockchain networks

## Authentication and Authorization

### API Key Management
- API keys are used for authentication
- Each key can have specific permissions (read, write, admin)
- Initial admin API key is created during first run
- Additional API keys can be generated using the utility script:
  ```
  npx ts-node src/utils/create-api-key.ts
  ```
- API keys should be included in requests as:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
  ```
